for physical build 30 business days they take  
1:44:43 AM
   
1:44:50 AM
that means 6 weeks  
1:45:05 AM
per week they work 15 to 20 hours  
1:45:28 AM
even if it is 15 per week then total of 100 hours required to build 2 physical servers  
1:45:40 AM
you can take 100 to start with for your calculation  
1:45:57 AM
but let me get the SA assigned and you can check with him actual hours required
